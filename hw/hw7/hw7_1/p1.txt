// Assembly 1
Memory to execute forwarding takes place between the thrid and forth instructions. 
	ld r2, r1, 0
	add r2, r1, r2
After stalling for one clock cycle, MEM-EX forwarding happens and the value of r2
gets forwarded to execution stage for add instruction. We also forward from instruction
1 to instruction 3 using MEM-EX forwarding. Instruction 1 and 3 are shown below. 
	lbi r1, 0x1
	ld r2, r1, 0

// Assembly 2
This file should test EX-EX forwarding between the two intructions:
	lbi r2, 0x2
	add r1, r2, r2
The immediate value of r2 gets forwarded for addition at the start of 
EX stage

// Assembly 3
This file tests EX-D forwarding for branch resolve:
	lbi r1, 0x0
	beqz r1, 2
The immediate value of r1 gets forwarded for branch resolution to ID stage.
If the forwarding path works, subi will be skipped and addi will be executed.
If not, both of them will be executed
